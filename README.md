# Boots-Haraguchi
## Reproducing work from Boots and Haraguchi

The files with the name format 'Boots & Haraguchi Model #[number]' are the pairwise invasion plots which I have replicated from the paper. The reason that there are three of these files is because I tried to get the results in three different ways. The third is the one that worked the best.

#1 = I calculate the equilibrium points each time using the same initial conditions in the ODE solver.

#2 = I calculate the equilibrium points each time but use the previous equilbrium points as the initial conditions in the ODE solver. 

#3 = I have inputted the equations for the equilbrium points.
