# Boots-Haraguchi
Reproducing work from Boots and Haraguchi


The files with the name format 'Boots & Haraguchi Model #[number]' are the pairwise invasion plots which I have replicated from the paper. The reason that there are three of
these files is because I tried to get the results in three different ways. The third is the one that worked the best.
#1 =
#2 = 
#3 =
